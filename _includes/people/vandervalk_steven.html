    <span class="person">Steven van Der Valk</span>
    is a Data Scientist at Fino Consulting in NYC, where he applies statistical and machine learning approaches to projects 
    in the education and energy sectors. Previously, he was a postdoc at Tufts University where he performed neuroscience 
    research aimed at better understanding learning and memory using high throughput RNA sequencing. As someone who had to 
    slowly gain programming skills to understand the large biological data sets generated by his research, he is excited to 
    make the process a bit easier for others.
