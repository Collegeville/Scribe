    <span class="person">Michael Koontz</span> is a PhD student in
    ecology at the University of California, Davis. He studies how
    heterogeneous spatial patterns of vegetation affect forest
    resilience to wildfires and bark beetle outbreaks. He works in R
    and Google Earth Engine, and is really excited by the challenge of
    teaching programming to folks that donâ€™t know where to begin.
