            G.K. Chesterton wrote, “If a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly.”
            Zig Ziglar refines this idea with his own quote, “Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly--until you can learn to do it well.”
            A good habit for “continual process improvement” is to complete a retrospective
            any time you have come to the end of a major activity in work (and life in general).

            Retrospectives, formerly known by the darker term “post-mortems,” have become popular in the Agile software development community
            and are healthy activity for any individual or group effort. The basic process is simple: take time to answer a few questions
            about your experiences in a given activity, and synthesize the results into concrete actions
            that can be applied the next time you are starting a similar kind of effort.
