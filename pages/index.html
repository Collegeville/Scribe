      <p>Scribe is dedicated to promoting and teaching effective (technical) writing.  You will find resources for learning the tools of technical writing (specially the LaTeX writing environment) and best practices in effective writing.  While the content here is particularly focused on writing for science, engineering and other technical fields, it can be valuable to anyone who wants to learn efficient, compact writing skills.

      <p>A major focus of the Scribe Project is clear writing through the repeated practice of reducing word count, while still conveying essential meaning.  Compact writing enables clear expression and readability.
