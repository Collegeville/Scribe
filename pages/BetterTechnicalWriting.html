                Compact, precise and literal writing is desirable in most disciplines,
                but is essential in technical fields.
                Wordy, imprecise and metaphoric text dilutes and confuses the reader of a technical document.
                In this exercise we will work on improving our skills.

                    <strong>Checklist for concise writing:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li> <strong>Eliminate small words:</strong> Scan each sentence for groups of small words.  Often the sentence can be re-worded to eliminate them.  <strong>Goal: increase average character count per words.</strong>
                        <li> <strong>Avoid gratuitous adjectives and adverbs unless they are <s>really</s> needed:</strong> Remove adjectives and adverbs that only vaguely help the reader. <strong>Goal: Really, truly, eliminate unneeded adjectives and adverbs.</strong>
                        <li> <strong>Remove redundant sentences:</strong> Scan each paragraph for sentences that don't carry their own weight. <strong>Goal: Each sentence should be essential so that, if you remove it, the paragraph will not make sense.</strong>
                        <li> <strong>Remove redundant paragraphs:</strong> Do for paragraphs what you did for sentences.
