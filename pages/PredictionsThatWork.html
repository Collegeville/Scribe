                Any efforts in developing technology require regular assessment of where technical opportunities lie,
                what uses are important and which trends are changing. Knowing the fundamental drivers in a technology field
                (and nearby fields that may impact the value proposition of a given field) is very important.
                And making decisions that will lead to correct choices for new technology development
                is essential for success, especially for organizational leaders.
            </p>
            <h4>Challenge:</h4>
            As important as making predictions is, it is very hard to do, especially when you are new in a field.
            Also, good technology decisions are not based solely on technical issues; human behavior and social systems
            are major elements in making good predictions,
            as is being the right person in the right place at the right time with the right resources.

            <h4>Approach:</h4>
            A universally valuable approach for accurate prediction is to develop <strong><em>models</em></strong> of the entities and relationships
            that are elements in your decision-making process. Models help you to identify and reason about the essentials
            and eliminate aspects that are secondary or irrelevant.
