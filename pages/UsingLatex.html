            <h3>Getting started</h3>
            An easy way to get started with LaTeX  is to use an online LaTeX environment such as
            <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a>.
            <br>
            <h3>Installing LaTeX on your own system</h3>
            All LaTeX IDEs (see below) require an installation of the LaTeX compiling environment.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Linux:</strong> LaTeX is typically installed on most Linux systems already.
            If not, it is available using the package manager of your flavor of Linux.
            <br>
            <strong>Mac:</strong> MacTeX is the standard LaTeX installation for Macs. A large but easily installed package is
            <a href="http://www.tug.org/mactex/">here</a>
            <br>
            <strong>Window:</strong>
            <a href="http://miktex.org/">MicTeX</a> is commonly used on Windows.
            <br>
            <strong>Tablets:</strong>
            <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tex-writer-latex-editor-compiler/id552717222?mt=8">TeX Writer</a>  TeX Writer and
            <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/texpad-latex-editor/id550419159?mt=8">Texpad</a>
            are two well regarded apps for iOS.  I am not familiar with Android versions.

            <h3>Command Line Compilation of your LaTeX source</h3>
            Command line environments like Linux terminal windows, Mac Terminal and Cygwin on Windows
            have a native LaTeX environment using the command pdflatex and bibtex.
            This is an efficient way to compile LaTeX source files for advanced users.
            Typically a makefile drives the whole process.
            <br>

            <h3>LaTeX IDEs</h3>
            Although it is possible to use a plain editor and compile LaTeX files directly (and there is some merit to this approach),
            many people prefer to use an <em>integrated development environment </em>(IDE).

            <h3>TeXStudio</h3>
            My favorite LaTeX IDE is
            <a href="http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/">TexStudio</a>
            . It is free software available for Windows, Mac and Linux.
            It uses the underlying LaTeX compiling environment and provides lots of ease-of-use features.

            <strong>TeXShop:</strong>
            Macs have the popular <a href="http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/">TeXShop</a>, which is also free to download.

            <strong>WinEdt:</strong> Windows systems have <a href="http://www.winedt.com/">WinEdt</a>,
            which is available individually as a free trial version and at a modest cost for a full license.
            This used to be my favorite editor until TeXStudio came along.
            A nice free tool for managing BibTeX references is <a href="http://www.jabref.org/"> JabRef</a>.

            <h3>First Example: sample.tex</h3>
            Download this zip file to your desktop: <a href="/Scribe/data/sample.zip">sample.zip</a>

            <h3>More Example Projects</h3>
            In addition to the simple example, the following gzipped tar files contain helpful starting points:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="/Scribe/data/IEEEtranBST.zip">Baseline IEEE example for submitting papers to IEEE publications.</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="/Scribe/data/HerouxPaper.zip">A paper of Dr. Heroux's</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    LaTeX can also be used to develop high-quality presentations.
                    <a href="/Scribe/data/CSC11.zip">Here is an example</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Using Docker to create Latex file</h3>
            Besides using some built-in application for writing Latex, using Docker for writing Latex is also recommended.
