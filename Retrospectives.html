            G.K. Chesterton wrote, “If a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly.”
            Zig Ziglar refines this idea with his own quote, “Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly--until you can learn to do it well.”
            A good habit for “continual process improvement” is to complete a retrospective
            any time you have come to the end of a major activity in work (and life in general).
            <br>
            <br>
            Retrospectives, formerly known by the darker term “post-mortems,” have become popular in the Agile software development community
            and are healthy activity for any individual or group effort. The basic process is simple: take time to answer a few questions
            about your experiences in a given activity, and synthesize the results into concrete actions
            that can be applied the next time you are starting a similar kind of effort.
            <br>

            <h4>Retrospective questions:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li> What worked well for us?</li>
                <li> What did not work well for us?</li>
                <li> What actions can we take to improve our process going forward?</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Approach:</h4>
            <p class="text-justify">A universally valuable approach for accurate prediction is to develop <strong><em>models</em></strong> of the entities and relationships
                that are elements in your decision-making process. Models help you to identify and reason about the essentials
                and eliminate aspects that are secondary or irrelevant.</p>

            <h4> In-class exercise: </h4>
            <ol>
                <li> Review the activities we have done in CSCI 373 throughout the semester.
                    See the course
                    <a href="">Website</a> and
                    <a href="">Handbook</a> to form the complete list.
                </li>
                <li> Using Google Docs and in small group</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Develop the list of activities we have done this semester, include written and speaking assignments,
                        reading/listening/viewing reflections and in-class activities and assignments.
                    </li>
                    <li>Collect individual responses to each of the above three questions for each activity in your group document.</li>
                    <li>Discuss individual responses as a group and synthesize your responses for the third question for each activity.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
